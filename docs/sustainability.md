# Sustainability

Running GDB on cloud platforms is distinct from university HPC clusters. Many university HPC systems lack stringent resource control and primarily monitor CPU usage. To succeed on these clusters, optimizing algorithms and workflows usually suffices to avoid problems like RAM or storage limitations. In contrast, cloud setups offer in-depth resource monitoring and cost accounting, including CPU time, memory, storage, and network traffic. This underscores the importance of optimizing resource use throughout the workflow for cost management. While this may seem demanding, cloud provider charges accurately mirror overall resource consumption. This highlights the critical need for resourcefulness and environmentally conscious computing practices in scientific research, both now and in the future.
